<p>I tried <a href="http://www.faroo.com/hp/api/api.html" target="_blank">Faroo</a> - a search API that I was considering to use for a mobile app. Faroo is free for up to a million requests a month. Probably the most generous among the free plans available from the competition. Signup is straight forward but it took a few days to receive the key. Just append the key to the search requests and you are done.</p>
<p>It appears that Faroo is more focused on Europe or the US as search results for India focused products did not produce any results. Since the app that I am looking to build is India-centric, I am looking at a search API that can bring in results related to India. Many of the searches produced no results.</p>
<p>I next tried <a href="https://webhose.io/pricing" target="_blank">Webhose.io</a>, another search API but a more restrictive plan of 1000 requests per month. Signup done and received the key in less than a minute. Search results brought in results on India-specific terms. The quality of results was impressive too. It is the pricing that is steep and preventing me from going ahead with using the API.</p>
<p>As it stands, I have to decide between free/low price with not much quality or expensive results with quality. Or maybe I will figure out a third option. I will continue exploring for now.</p>
