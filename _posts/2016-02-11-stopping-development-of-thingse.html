<p>The last post here was over 5 months ago. Why did I not post anything for so long? Because there was no development on Thingse. I had planned on adding various features such as moving to a backend-as-a-service for the database, adding search capabilities, login using social ID etc. But the motivation was gradually dwindling as I did not see much interest in the app (had shared the APK to a few folks). I believe that the app more than served its purpose: allowing me to get started with Android programming, helping me move to Android Studio, Gradle and Material Design. The source code and binary of the app is available in <a href="https://github.com/daneshzaki/Thingse" target="_blank">Github</a>. Anyone who is interested to take it forward is welcome to do so.</p>
